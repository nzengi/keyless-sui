# Sui Keyless Protocol

## Abstract

Sui Keyless Protocol is an innovative protocol that provides a secure, decentralized, and transparent signing infrastructure between blockchain applications (dApps) and digital wallets. Using BLS threshold signing technology, it eliminates traditional key management problems and improves user experience.

## Problem Statement

In the current Web3 ecosystem:

- Users must manually sign wallet transactions for each operation
- Private key management is risky and not user-friendly
- No secure communication standard between dApps and wallets
- Signature requests are not transparent and auditable
- Compromise of a single private key puts all assets at risk

## Solution

Keyless Protocol offers these innovative solutions:

### 1. Decentralized Verification

- dApps register by proving domain ownership
- Wallets can easily identify trusted dApps
- Protection against fake dApps

### 2. Threshold Signing

- Signing authority is distributed among multiple validators
- Eliminates single point of failure risk
- High efficiency with BLS signing

### 3. Smart Contract Security

- All transactions are transparent on-chain
- Signature requests and approvals are auditable
- Old requests invalidated through timeout mechanism

### 4. User Experience

- Wallets can give granular permissions to dApps
- Automatic signing for recurring transactions
- Users don't need to manage private keys
